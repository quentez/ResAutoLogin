# INSA House Connector

## About

This small Windows Executable aims at reducing the hassle of having to re-authenticate any time you shutdown or unplug your computer from the INSA House Network.

With _INSA House Connector_ you enter your identification information once and you're done.

## How to install

- Install the _.Net Framework 4.5 Beta_ from the [Microsoft website](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=28978).
- Install the _INSA House Connector_ using [this link](http://update.quentez.com/reslogin/setup.exe).

The App contains an auto-updater so you won't have to worry about having to install new versions as they'll be released.

At the moment, the program won't register itself to start with Windows. If you want that, you can add a shortcut to the tool in the **Startup** folder of the **Start Menu**.

If you find any bug, or have suggestions regarding this App, don't hesitate to open a GitHub issue and I'll try to answer it quickly.

If you want to improve the codebase, or add new features by yourself, you're welcome to clone this repository. You will need the _Visual Studio 11 Beta_ to work on this project though.
